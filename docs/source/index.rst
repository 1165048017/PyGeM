Python utilities for geometrical morphing.


Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyGeM is a python library using Free Form Deformation to parametrize and morph complex geometries. It is ideally suited for actual industrial problems, since it allows to handle:

- Computer Aided Design files (in .iges and .stl formats)
- Mesh files (in .unv and OpenFOAM formats)
- Output files (in .vtk format)

By now, it has been used with meshes with up to 14 milions of cells. Try with more and more complicated input files!

Tutorials
^^^^^^^^^^

We made some tutorial examples:

- `Tutorial 1 <tutorial1stl.html>`_ shows how to deal with stl files
- `Turorial 2 <tutorial2iges.html>`_ shows how to deal with iges files
- `Turorial 3 <tutorial3unv.html>`_ shows how to deal with unv files and how to set the desired continuity to the geometry
