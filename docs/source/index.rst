Python utilities for geometrical morphing.


Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyGeM is a python library using Free Form Deformation to parametrize and morph complex geometries. It is ideally suited for actual industrial problems, since it allows to handle:

- Computer Aided Design files (in .iges and .stl formats)
- Mesh files (in .unv and OpenFOAM formats)
- Output files (in .vtk format)

By now, it has been used with meshes with up to 14 milions of cells. Try with more and more complicated input files!
