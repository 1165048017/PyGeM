# Tutorials

In this folder you can find a collection of useful tutorials in order to understand the principles and the potential of **PyGeM**.

#### [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/mathLab/PyGeM/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-1-stl.ipynb)
Here we show how it is possible to perform a free form deformation on a sphere together with how to deal with stl files.

#### [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/mathLab/PyGeM/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-2-iges.ipynb)
Here we show how to manage basic iges files and again free form deformation. In particular here we deform the CAD of a cylinder.

#### [Tutorial 3](https://github.com/mathLab/PyGeM/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-3-unv.ipynb)
Here it is possible to understand how to deform a unv file with a prescribed continuity using the free form deformation.

#### [Tutorial 4](https://github.com/mathLab/PyGeM/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-4-rbf.ipynb)
Here we present the radial basis functions interpolation technique on a simple cube.

#### [Tutorial 5](https://github.com/mathLab/PyGeM/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-5-idw.ipynb)
Here we show the inverse distance weighting interpolation technique on a simple cube.


#### More to come...
We plan to add more tutorials but the time is often against us. If you want to contribute with a notebook on a feature not covered yet we will be very happy and give you support on editing!
